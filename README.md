# Diabetes Predictor

Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the world, according to the World Health Organisation. Diabetes is a metabolic disease categorised by high levels of blood sugar, which can cause damage to the heart, kidneys, pancreas and many more organs. Diabetes occurs when the body is unable to use the insulin it produces, given that the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. According to WHO, an estimated of 1.6 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes in 2016.

This notebook looks into using Python-based Machine Learning and Data Science libraries in an attempt to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has diabetes based on their medical attributes.
